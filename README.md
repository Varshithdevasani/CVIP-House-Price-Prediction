I utilized the incredible capabilities of Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook platform, to develop a highly accurate house price prediction model.  I collected a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes of houses, including location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and historical sales prices. With the collected data, I performed thorough data cleaning, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations. This step ensured that the data was in a suitable format for training the model.To evaluate the model's performance, I employed various evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared.
